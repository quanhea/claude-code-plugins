Choose execution mode:

**Skill (interactive)** - Use when:
- Quick question with likely follow-ups
- Need to refine the search interactively
- Want to stay in conversation flow

**Agent (autonomous)** - Use when:
- Deep investigation across many files
- Complex question requiring extensive search
- Want results without interaction

Ask the user which mode to use, then either load the `ask` skill or spawn the `codebase-qa` agent.
